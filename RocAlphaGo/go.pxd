       Ladder evaluation consumes a lot of time duplicating data, the original
       version (still can be found in go_python.py) made a copy of the whole

       This version only duplicates self.board_groups (so the list with pointers to groups)
       the add_ladder_move playes a move like the add_to_group function but it
       does not change the original groups and creates a list with groups removed

       be the same as before add_ladder_move was called

       duplicating self.board_groups is not neccisary stricktly speaking but
       it is safer to do so in a threaded environment. as soon as mcts is
       implemented this duplication could be removed if the mcts ensures a
